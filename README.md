Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a simple visual guide that represents the layout and structure of a web page, app, or digital interface. It focuses on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user experience without getting into detailed design aspects like colors, images, or final content.

Importance in the Design Process
Clarifies Structure and Layout
Wireframes help designers and stakeholders visualize the basic framework of a project, ensuring everyone agrees on the content hierarchy and page structure.

Facilitates Communication
Wireframes act as a communication tool between designers, developers, and clients, making it easier to gather feedback and align expectations early.

Saves Time and Resources
By identifying issues and refining the user flow at an early stage, wireframing helps avoid costly changes during later development or design phases.
